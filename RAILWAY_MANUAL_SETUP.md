# üõ§Ô∏è Railway Manual Setup Guide

## Issue: Railway Still Using Nixpacks

Even with `railway.toml` configured for Docker, Railway might still try to use Nixpacks due to caching or detection issues.

## Manual Configuration Solution

### Step 1: Create New Railway Project
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose: `adhcode/betadomotweb`

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings Manually
1. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Go to "Build" section

2. **Force Docker Build**:
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty (Docker will handle)
   - **Start Command**: Leave empty (Docker CMD will handle)
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Dockerfile Path**: `Dockerfile` (relative to root directory)

3. **Build Method**:
   - If there's an option to choose build method, select "Dockerfile"
   - If Railway auto-detects Nixpacks, look for "Override" or "Custom" build options

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add these in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables:

```env
PORT=8080
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

### Step 4: Force Redeploy
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
3. Railway should now use Docker instead of Nixpacks

## Alternative: Delete and Recreate Project

If Railway is still stuck on Nixpacks:

1. **Delete the current Railway project**
2. **Create a new project** from scratch
3. **Ensure root directory is set to `backend`**
4. **Railway should detect Dockerfile automatically**

## Verification

Once deployed successfully, test:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Should return: {"status": "healthy", "service": "blog-api"}
```

## Why This Happens

Railway sometimes caches build detection. When switching from Nixpacks to Docker:
- Old build cache might persist
- Detection algorithms might conflict
- Manual override ensures Docker is used

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Build logs show Docker commands (FROM, RUN, COPY)
‚úÖ No "Nixpacks build failed" errors
‚úÖ Application starts successfully
‚úÖ Health endpoint responds

Your BetaDomot backend will deploy successfully with Docker! üê≥
